## **Instructions**
1. Click on `Accept Assignment` at the link posted on Moodle. This is equivalent to forking the repository.</font>
2. Navigate to the repository you just forked. It should be named `pa6-<your-github-username>`
3. Click on the green `Code` button. Click on SSH tab and copy the SSH link (it is important to use SSH and not HTTPS).
4. Open the terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
5. Run `git clone <copied-ssh-link>`. Replace `<copied-ssh-link>` with the link you copied in step 3.
6. In Visual Studio Code, click on File -> Open and open the folder of the repository. 

## **Code Review**
This assignment will only be graded after you schedule and complete an in-person code review 
with the instructor within 5 working days after the due date, if not earlier. \

<h1><center>Heaps</h1></center>

<br/>

1. In this assignment, you are to implement the `Heap` interface in the `Heap` file provided. The interface defines the methods that you need to implement. 

    Make sure to read the java doc comments in the `Heap` interface to understand the requirements of each method.

    You are to implement two classes that implement the `Heap` interface: `MaxHeap` and `MinHeap`, which represent a max heap and a min heap, respectively. Each class should be in its own file.

    Feel free to define any additional <u>private</u> helper methods or classes as needed. 

    <u><b>You must use an array to store the elements in the heap.</b></u>

2. You are to write JUnit test cases in the `MaxHeapTest` and `MinHeapTest` file to test your implementation.

    Make sure to test all the methods in the `MaxHeapTest` and `MinHeapTest` class, keeping in mind any <u>edge cases</u> that may arise.

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the correctness **_and completeness_** of your implementation and test cases. If your implementation is correct but your test cases are incomplete, you will lose points. If your implementation is incorrect, you will lose even more points.
